Project_Description.

Designed and developed a data-driven system to help farmers predict crop yields using advanced data mining techniques and historical agricultural data.
Incorporated environmental, soil, and climatic variables into the model for more accurate forecasting and decision-making.
Conducted thorough data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure high-quality input for the prediction model.
Enhanced the model with iterative testing and validation using real-world datasets, achieving reliable prediction
